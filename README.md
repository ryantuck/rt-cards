Cards
========

## A revolutionary task manager app for OSX

Cards is a powerful GTD-inspired task manager designed to show you only what you need to see, and get out of your way as fast as possible. 

Ultimately, it will be a visually-stimulating cross-platform solution to the problem of to-do paralysis. 

## Progress

7 Aug 2014

The first acceptable working version of Cards is complete enough that I can use it to manage my tasks reliably. 

The UI is currently designed using run-of-the-mill Apple buttons and sliders. These have been put in place as rudimentary controls. Now that backend functionality is basically in place, I can begin redesigning the UI from the ground up. 

There's still a lot of work ahead to make Cards into my vision for a perfect task manager. But the initial building phase has been completed. 

## Inspiration

Cards is a project inspired by the inability of every digital task manager I've come across to conform to a solid GTD system. Some problems I've run into:

- Evernote isn't designed to manage tasks. 
- Wunderlist is too simple.
- Things is too ugly.
- Omnifocus doesn't do it for me. 
- Trello doesn't support offline editing. 
- Paper and pencil isn't mobile enough. 

I also needed to buckle down and prove to myself (and potential employers!) that I'm fully capable of building out a quality app.
